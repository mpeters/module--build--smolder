NAME
    Module::Build::Smolder - Extra build targets for sending smoke tests to
    a Smolder server

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Easily add support for extra build targets to send TAP Archives to a
    Smolder server

    In your Build.PL

        use Module::Builder::Smolder;
        my $builder = Module::Builder::Smolder->new(
            ...
        );

    Now you get these build targets

        ]$ perl Build.PL
        ]$ ./Build smolder ...

NEW TARGETS
    The following build targets are provided:

  smolder
    Create a TAP archive and then send it to Smolder.

   Required Flags
     This target needs to know where to send the archive, so it needs the following options:

    --server
    --project_id

        ]$ ./Build smolder --server mysmolder.com --username foo --password s3cr3t --project_id 5

   Optional Flags
    --username
        The Smolder user uploading the report. If not specified it will be
        uploaded anonymously

    --password
    --archive_file
        Specify the file to store the archive

    --architecture
        Name of the architecture for the report

    --platform
        Name of the CPU platform

    --tags
        Comma separated list of tags for this report

    --comments
        Free form text to associate with the smoke report

    --use_existing_archive
        If you've already run the tests and created a TAP Archive and you
        just want to submit that one to Smolder again, use this flag so that
        it doesn't run the tests again. Really useful when troubleshooting.
